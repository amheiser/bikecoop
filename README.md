# St. Pete Bike Coop — Member Management

A small, boring-on-purpose member-management app for a cooperative bike shop:
people & profiles, daily check-ins, volunteer hours & milestone rewards,
behavior flags, annual memberships, and reporting/export. It replaces a legacy
Ruby on Rails app ("Freehub").

**Stack:** Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript, SQLite via `better-sqlite3`,
plain CSS. No ORM, no component libraries. See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for the
full domain model, design decisions, and build roadmap, and
[PROGRESS.md](PROGRESS.md) for the dated changelog.

## Running locally

Requires Node 20+.

```bash
npm install
cp .env.local.example .env.local   # or create .env.local by hand, see below
npm run dev
```

`.env.local` needs:

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `AUTH_USERNAME` | Shared login username for the whole app |
| `AUTH_PASSWORD` | Shared login password |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | Random string used to sign the session cookie (e.g. `openssl rand -hex 32`) |
| `DATABASE_PATH` | Optional. SQLite file path; defaults to `./bikecoop.db` |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | Optional. Enables real sending of lapsed-member renewal emails; without it, sends are dry-run (logged, not sent) |
| `EMAIL_FROM` | Sender for renewal emails, e.g. `St. Pete Bike Coop <members@example.org>` (required only with `RESEND_API_KEY`) |

The database file is created and migrated automatically on first request
(`db/schema.sql` + the idempotent migrations in `lib/db.ts`). The local dev
database is disposable and gitignored — delete `bikecoop.db*` any time to
start fresh. Use **Reports → Sample Data** in the app to load/clear a test
dataset.

## Tests

```bash
npm test
```

Unit tests (`tests/`) run against an in-memory SQLite database via Node's
built-in test runner — no framework, no network, sub-second.

## Deployment

Deployed on Render; every push to `main` auto-deploys. Production needs the
same env vars as above, plus `DATABASE_PATH=/var/data/bikecoop.db` pointing at
a persistent disk. Before go-live: attach the persistent disk and set up a
periodic off-box backup of the SQLite file.

## Conventions

- Dates are stored as ISO `YYYY-MM-DD` strings, always computed in the shop's
  timezone (`lib/dates.ts`) — never from the server's UTC clock.
- Dependencies are pinned exactly; don't add packages without a strong reason.
- Keep the UI obvious enough for a non-technical volunteer at a front desk.
